bulk remove 

handle bulk add 

remove listing 

timeout listing 

make sure we know which has algorithm for the commit vote step (keccak256)

migrate github 

bulk resolve

resolve challenge is wrong! fix it

fix batch remove payout 

handle token change

find out if require in loop reverts all emitted events (it does not)

lock playlist (lock propose and challenge but dont lock current polls)

fix poll to not create a whole new object in create poll

change finalized to closed 

rename listing to crate

dont think we need appWasMade

change deposit to minDeposit

change allowlisted to listed? 

handle remnants  (account for number of voters)

ensure no reentrancy on poll withdrawals for winers 

enable payout address (splits module) for challenge

ensure that poll reward pool is being decremented when someone withdraws their winnings

handle remove listing decrement listLength !

handle length of playlist

set the max list amount of uin256? SHOULD WE set to zero if we dont care about list length? (idk because there will always actually be a length)

update max list length

decide who to send remnants to (the proposer or challenger)
break out into its own function. <<<< didnt do this. Its instead being paid out when the last user withdraws.

handle batch remove refund amount <<< not sure we can do this, we need to pay out each record's owner address

ensure that payouts for listing removal's account for challenges and whether or not they have any thing to deposit. SHOULD WE ONLY PAYOUT WHEN SOMETHING IS REMOVED OR WHEN A CHALLENGE US RESOLVED? 

emit app duration expiry times

emit list duration expiry times

move unchecked to just counter

do we need an admin feature? if so, we could probably use a mapping instead of just setting a function << we dont need admin functionality at this point only owner is just fine

curator tip function on crate 

crate owner tip function 

add description;

CrateFactory 

PayableContract? pay lister or owner

Sort order !! yay ended up going with a linked list and i think its siiiick. 

remove sort order if listing is removed (resolve challenge, remove listing , batch remove listing)

make internal functions for updates

add modifiers

private listing? aes ? 
^^ submit both the secret md5 hash and the aes encrypted hash. They should match once unvieled to prove that they were pointing to the same data
