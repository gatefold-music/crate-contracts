think about sort order (red black tree)

private listing? 

length of playlist 

do we need an admin feature? if so, we could probably use a mapping instead of just setting a function 

emit app and list duration expiry times

handle batch remove refund amount

decide who to send remnants to 
break out into its own function

do i have to set the max amount of uin256? or does it default to 0 ? 

handle remove listing decrement listLength !

/ DONE

bulk remove 

handle bulk add 

remove listing 

timeout listing 

make sure we know which has algorithm for the commit vote step (keccak256)

migrate github 

bulk resolve

resolve challenge is wrong! fix it

fix batch remove payout 

handle token change

find out if require in loop reverts all emitted events (it does not)

lock playlist (lock propose and challenge but dont lock current polls)

fix poll to not create a whole new object in create poll

change finalized to closed 

rename listing to crate

dont think we need appWasMade

change deposit to minDeposit

change allowlisted to listed? 

handle remnants  (account for number of voters)

ensure no reentrancy on poll withdrawals for winers 

enable payout address (splits module) for challenge

ensure that poll reward pool is being decremented when someone withdraws their winnings
